### What is this /SciterSharpCPP folder?
This CPP source code consists of a more elegant Object-Oriented aproach over Sciter API, that is, these are just C++ wraper classes over the Sciter C/C++ API.

### But Sciter SDK already contains C++ classes for this purpouse, so why another C++ wraper?
Classes here are exactly the equivalent of classes from SciterSharp library (my C# bindings for Sciter, https://github.com/MISoftware/SciterSharp)
so, this wrapers classes allows one to easily port a C# code to C++/Obj-C.

That's why the 'SciterSharpCPP' name.
